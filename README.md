# VibeGift
The absolute best way to find gifts for every person, for every occasion. An instance of the application is hosted [here](https://vibe-gift.lovable.app) with a mock database.

## Info
The code is for an application that will work as an AI powered gift finder. It has a mock database of products and descriptions with images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com). The user can enter the recipient's information and they'll be presented with gifts, with AI (wow!). If the community really loves this one, I can add an LLM powered functionality where they can provide more arbitrary recipient description ("My kid loves this wooden spoon, he's 12 and we live in Germany..."). For now, feel free to use the code as a base for your own work. Feel free to reach out if you need help with anything.
